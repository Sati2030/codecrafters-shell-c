# POSIX Shell Implementation

This project is a **POSIX-compliant shell** inspired by the CodeCrafters **"Build Your Own Shell"** challenge. It includes implementations of built-in commands such as `cd`, `pwd`, and `type`, along with features like:

- **Program execution**
- **Directory navigation**
- **Quoting and redirection**
- **Autocompletion**
- **Additional custom features beyond the original challenge**

Feel free to explore the project, and if you're interested in tackling the challenge yourself you can check it out below! ðŸš€
